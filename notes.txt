	-	<b>, <i>, <u>, <p>, <div>, <span>
-	lists
	-	ordered list	
	-	unorderes list
-	tables

HTML 5 features



															Javascript
															----------
What is the difference between programming language and scripting language?
	programming language
		source code		→	intermediate code  			→	run time 
						    (is stored in the disk)
	scripting language
		source code		→	is parsed by the interpreter 	→	browser executes the parsed code
							on the fly

should we install any software to work with javascript?
	NO
	every browser has it's own javascript engine to execute javascript code.

what is javascript?
	it is a client-side scripting language
	In recent days, Javascript also work on server side.

	MEAN stack	(MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node)
	MERN stack	(MongoDB, Express, React, Node)


	Node JS (or) Node 	→	which is used to run Javascript programs in the server.

client softwares (browser):
	firefox
	chrome		→	v8 engine	(jaavscript)
	safari		
	edge (internet explorer)

HTML	→	to design static web pages
CSS		→	to apply styling

Javascript is used to place dynamic content into the html page, client-side validations.
It is a lightweight programming language.
reacts to events
to perform client-side validations


static web site		→ 	will offer static content
dynamic web site	→ 	content is changed for every user.



1) place our javascript code in our html.

		<head>
			<script type="text/javascript">
				javascript code
			</script>
		</head>

		<body>
			<script type="text/javascript">
				javascript code
			</script>
		</body>

2) write javascript code in a separate ".js" file
		link this ".js" file in a html code.

Javascript IDEs:
----------------
1) VS Code
2) Sublime
3) Atom
4) Brackets


datatype	:	what type of data holding by the variable currently.
variable	:	it is a placeholder of data in the memory.

should we declare variables in Javascript?
	NO

datatypes in javascipt?
	number
	string
	boolean
	null

declaring variables?
	let, var, const

variable naming rules:
+	it can have alphabets, digits, underscore
+	it cannot have spaces or any other punctuation symbols
+	variable names are case sensituve


operators:
+	arithmetic operators	(calculate)
		+	-	*	/	%	++	--
		+=	-=	*=	/=	%=
+	relational operators	(comparision)
		>		<	==	>=	<=	!=
+	logical operators		(combining conditions)
		&&   (and)		||  (or)		!	(not)


control structures:
-------------------
set of keywords that alter the program execution sequence.

1) decision ming statements
	a) if		: bi-directional decision making statement

		if (condition)
			true-statement;
		else
			false-statement;
	b) switch	:	multi-directional decision making statement.

		switch (var) {
			case   value-1 : statement(s);
						     break;
			case   value-2 : statement(s);
							 break;
			case   value-3 : statement(s);
						     break;

			...		...		...
					default : statement(s);
							  break;
		}
2) looping statements	
	a) for		:	statements are executed repeatedly as long as the condition is true.

			for(initialization; condition; update expression) {
				statement(s);
			}

	b) while	:	statements are executed repeatedly as long as the condition is true.

			while(condition) {
				statement(s);
			}

	c) do..while	:	statements are executed repeatedly as long as the condition is true.

			do {
				statement(s);
			} while (condition);

	* for and while loop are called top-tested (entry-tested) loops.
	  whereas do..while loop is called bottom-tested (exit-tested) loops.

	* minimum number of iterations in for and while are 0.
	  whereas in do..while it is 1.


pre-defined dialogboxes:
	alert()
	prompt()
	confirm()


accept a number from the user. i find whether the given number is +ve or -ve.
accept a number. find whether it is even or odd.


accept two numbers and an arithmetic operator. perform the operation 
and print the result.

parseInt(string-form-number) : convert the input into 'int' type.
parseFloat(string-form-number) : convert the input into 'float' type.


write a program to print natural numbers from 1 and n, where n is given by the user.
write a program to print natural numbers from 1 and n in reverse order, where n is given by the user.


Math object:
	providing pre-defined methods (functions).


Day-2  (15-mar-2022)
----------------------------------------------------
How to choose between for and while loop?
+	for loop is used when we want to execute set of statements for a finite number of times.
+	while loop is used when we want to execute set of statements for an indefinite number of times.

write a program to print the factorial of a given number?
	5! = 5*4*3*2*1

break: whenever a break statement is encountered, the control comes out of the loop without 
		executing the remaining statements in the current iteration.

continue: whenever a continue statement is encountered, the control go to the next iteration without 
		executing the remaining statements in the current iteration.


String object:
---------------
var str = 'hello';

every string has an internal indexer. using the 0-based index, we can access individual characters
like an array.
string is not a primitive type. 
it is an object.

1) length property

2) charAt()
3) concat()
4) startsWith()
5) endsWith()
6) indexOf()
7) lastIndexOf()
8) substr()
9) substring()
10) toLowerCase()
11) toUpperCase()
12) trim()
13) charCodeAt()	
14) includes()		: to check whether the string contains specified string or not
15) slice()
16) split()


ASCII  (American Standard Code for Information Interchange):
-------------------------------------------------------------
256 characters ( 0 to 255)

A    65				a   97			0   48			space		32
B    66				b   98			1	49			enter   	13
..					..				..				backspace	7
Z    90				z   122			9	57			tab			8


write a program to reverse a given string.


Arrays:
------------
+	array is a collection of values.
+	0-based index
+	elements can be modified
+	arrays in javascript are dynamic in nature.
+	every array is an object.



defining array:
------------------
names = new Array('Ramesh', 'Geetha', 'Kishore');
document.write(names + '<br>');


Arrays methods:
------------------
1) concat()
2) fill()
3) push()	: to add new elements at the end of the array.
4) pop()	: remove the last element of the array
5) unshift() : to add new element in the beginning of the array.
6) shift()	:  to delete the first element 
7) slice()	: select part of an array, and return them as new array.
8) splice() : add/remove elements from an array.

Date object:
-------------------
1) new Date()
2) new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, secinds, milliseconds)
3) new Date(string-form-date)

Date methods:
-------------------
1) getFullYear()
2) getMonth()	: 0 - 11
3) getDate()	: 1 - 31
4) getHours()
5) getMinutes()
6) getSeconds()
7) getMilliSeconds()
8) getTime()
9) getDay()		: 0 - 6		(weekday)

10) setDate()
..

accept date of birth from the user. calculate his/her age in years.


											functions	
											---------
It is a set of statements meant to perform a single task.											---------
It can be invoked by using its name.
It optionally take parameters on which it works. These parameters behave like local variables inside the function.
It optionally return a value to caller.

	defining a function:
	--------------------
	syntax:
	---------
	function   name(parameter-1, parameter-2, ...) {
			// code to perform single task
	}

	calling a function:
	-------------------
	[variable = ] name(arg-1, arg-2, ...);



											DOM
											----
DOM stands for Document Object Model.

Window object:
----------------
it represent the browser window.
all global javascript objects, functions, variables automatically become members of window object.
global variables are properties of window object
global functions are methods of windiw object.

window.open()
window.close()

Location object
History object

HTML DOM:
---------
allows javascript to access all elements and their attributes of HTML document.
HTML DOM is a tree of objects.
it is the programming interface of HTML.
it allows us to change the content of elements, add and delete elements, change the styles and handle the events.
Document object is the owner of all objects of HTML page.

Finding HTML elements:
----------------------
document.getElementById(id)
document.getElementsByTagName(tagName)
document.getElementsByClassName(cssClassName)
document.querySelectorAll(selector)
